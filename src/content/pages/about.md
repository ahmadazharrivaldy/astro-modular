Since November 2021, I have been working at PT Boer Technology (Btech). I love working with technology, especially building and managing systems in the cloud. I enjoy solving problems and making sure applications run smoothly and reliably.

## What I do

I have a strong background in Networking and focus on Cloud and DevOps. Here are the main tools and technologies I use:

- **Cloud Platform:** I can operate OpenStack, Kubernetes, and Juju.
- **Operating Systems:** I am very comfortable using Linux, especially Ubuntu and Red Hat.
- **Monitoring:** I use tools like Grafana, Prometheus, Zabbix, and Graylog to make sure systems are working correctly.

## Sharing is Caring

I also run a personal blog called dombajantan. I started this blog because I want to share what I learn with others for free. I believe that by sharing knowledge, we can all grow together.
